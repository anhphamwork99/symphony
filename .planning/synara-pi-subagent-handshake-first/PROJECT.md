# Synara Pi Subagent Handshake-First Handoff

## Routing metadata

- **Owner:** anhpham99
- **Lifecycle:** Implementation in progress — Ticket 01 accepted;
  Ticket 01 runtime-closure remediation (01b) opened by Decision 0006.
  Decision 0007's host-peer alignment prerequisite was delivered in
  `799af158a`; Decision 0008 now requires artifact-local TypeBox resolution
  or qualifying exact host-alias supply before its staged-closure AC4 proof.
- **Triage status:** 01b implementation complete pending independent review and
  final acceptance; 03 ready-for-agent; 02 remains blocked by 01b acceptance

- [decisions/0005-t01-final-acceptance.md](decisions/0005-t01-final-acceptance.md)
  — final acceptance of Ticket 01’s packaged artifact and fail-close boundary,
  artifact-closure premise amended by Decision 0006.
- [decisions/0006-t01-runtime-closure-reassessment.md](decisions/0006-t01-runtime-closure-reassessment.md)
  — binding Supervisor reassessment: the Ticket 01 artifact is an
  insufficient runtime closure for the real pinned Alfie extension; opened
  remediation Ticket 01b, stopped Ticket 02 real-runtime acceptance, and
  amended Decisions 0004/0005 narrowly.
- [decisions/0007-t01b-host-peer-compatibility-reassessment.md](decisions/0007-t01b-host-peer-compatibility-reassessment.md)
  — binding Supervisor reassessment: the real pinned artifact declares Pi
  peers `>=0.83.0`, while the current packaged host is `0.81.1`; AC4 requires
  host alignment or an Alfie-source-authoritative exact-tuple exception.
- [decisions/0008-t01b-normal-dependency-host-alias-reassessment.md](decisions/0008-t01b-normal-dependency-host-alias-reassessment.md)
  — binding Supervisor reassessment: the Pi loader's host alias for normal
  `@sinclair/typebox` cannot satisfy AC4 unless it is exact lock-identical or
  upstream-authoritatively compatible; prefer artifact-local resolution.
- [../synara-pi-durable-subagents/decisions/0001-testing-strategy-governance.md](../synara-pi-durable-subagents/decisions/0001-testing-strategy-governance.md)
  — accepted feature-level Testing Strategy Governance reused by this
  follow-on durable-subagent work.

## Current implementation frontier

- **01 — Package and fail-close the managed Pi artifact** is accepted by
  Decision 0005 (fail-close boundary; not reopened). Its runtime-closure
  remediation is tracked as Ticket 01b.
- **01b — Remediate the verified managed Pi runtime closure** has a complete
  implementation candidate. Decision 0007's host alignment was delivered in
  `799af158a`; Decision 0008's normal-dependency alias remediation and real
  staged-closure AC4 proof were delivered in `75a12e40c`. AC1–AC6 focused
  evidence is recorded in the ticket; independent review and exactly one
  Supervisor final-acceptance consultation are now required. Ticket 02 remains
  blocked until that acceptance completes.
- **02 — Bootstrap the verified managed harness and prove detached terminal
  lifecycle** is blocked by 01b per Decisions 0006 and 0007. Its real-runtime
  acceptance (AC1–AC4) is stopped; existing implementation remains
  in-progress work and no AC is complete. It retains its other
  responsibilities unchanged.
- **03 — Present durable execution-card truth** is unblocked and
  ready-for-agent.
- **04 — Prove desktop production composition and complete acceptance** is
  blocked by tickets 01b, 02, and 03; it remains packaged desktop/server
  final composition only and does not absorb the remediation.
